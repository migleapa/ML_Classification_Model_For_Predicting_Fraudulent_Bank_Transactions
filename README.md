# ML Classification Model For Predicting Fraudulent Bank Transactions for Imnalanced Data

Author: Migle Apanaviciute

Date: 23/05/2021

I built a simple classification model using the "BankTransactions.xlsx" data set for labeling fraudulent vs non-fraudulent bank transactions in Python.
This project is organized as follows: 
    (not included) data cleaning;
    (1 & 2) data loading and exploration; 
    (3) feature engineering; 
    (4) testing 5 probable algorithms for my data set; 
    (5) hyperparameters tuning and running Random Forest algorithm.

"BankTransactions.xlsx": dataset used for model building.

"ML Classification Model for Fraud Detection.ipynb": the Jupyter notebook containing code.

"data-dictionary.xlsx": explanation of some terms used in my data set
